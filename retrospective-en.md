# Solution Retrospective - QR Code Component

## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

### üéØ What I'm Most Proud Of

**Clean and Organized Code:**
- Used semantic HTML5 markup with `<main>` and `<article>` for better accessibility
- Organized CSS into separate files (global.css for reset styles, style.css for component)
- Applied BEM methodology for class naming (`card__image`, `card__heading`, `card__text`)

**Responsive Design:**
- Implemented mobile-first approach with correct display on all devices
- Used Flexbox for centering, ensuring layout flexibility
- Properly configured media queries for mobile devices

**CSS Custom Properties:**
```css
:root {
  --color-white: #fff;
  --color-black: #1F314F;
  --color-gray: #68778D;
}
```
This makes the code more maintainable and allows easy color scheme changes.

### üîÑ What I Would Do Differently Next Time

**CSS Improvements:**
- Add CSS animations for smooth card appearance
- Use CSS Grid combined with Flexbox for more flexible layout control
- Implement dark theme with toggle switch

**Accessibility:**
- Add focus-visible styles for better keyboard navigation
- Improve color contrast according to WCAG guidelines
- Add aria-labels for better screen reader support

**Performance:**
- Optimize images in WebP format with fallback
- Add preload for critical resources
- Use CSS containment for rendering optimization

**Development Tools:**
- Set up Sass/SCSS for more convenient CSS work
- Add automatic optimization and minification
- Use CSS-in-JS solutions for larger projects

### üìö Key Takeaways

1. **Simplicity is strength:** The project showed that even simple components require careful attention to detail
2. **Mobile-first works:** Mobile-first approach significantly simplified responsive design creation
3. **CSS Custom Properties are essential:** CSS variables make code more maintainable and flexible
4. **Semantics matter:** Proper HTML markup improves accessibility and SEO

### üéØ Future Plans

- Study CSS Grid more deeply for complex layouts
- Master animations and micro-interactions
- Dive deeper into accessibility best practices
- Practice with CSS preprocessors

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

### üöß Main Challenges and Solutions

**1. Perfect Card Centering:**
```css
/* Problem: card wasn't centering perfectly on all screens */
.main {
  height: 95%; /* Initially was 100vh, which created problems */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
**Solution:** Used `height: 95%` instead of `100vh` to account for attribution at the bottom and Flexbox for perfect centering.

**2. Responsiveness with Minimal Media Queries:**
```css
/* Challenge: make component responsive with minimal media queries */
.card {
  max-width: 320px; /* Fixed maximum width */
  padding: 16px 16px 40px 16px;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 475px) {
  .card {
    margin: 27.5px; /* Margins only on mobile */
  }
}
```
**Solution:** Used `max-width` and internal padding, adding media query only for mobile devices.

**3. Selecting Correct Colors:**
**Challenge:** JPG format layout required visual color selection without exact values.
**Solution:** 
- Used developer tools to analyze reference images
- Cross-referenced with `style-guide.md` for exact HSL values
- Applied CSS variables for easy color adjustments

**4. Typography and Spacing:**
```css
.card__heading {
  font-size: 22px;
  line-height: 120%; /* Visually selected */
  font-weight: 700;
}

.card__text {
  font-size: 15px;
  line-height: 140%; /* According to style-guide.md */
  letter-spacing: 0.2px;
}
```
**Solution:** Combined data from style-guide.md with visual comparison to the layout.

**5. CSS File Organization:**
**Challenge:** How to better structure styles for maintainability.
**Solution:**
- `global.css` - reset styles and general settings
- `style.css` - component styles
- Using CSS variables in `:root` for centralized management

**6. Semantic Markup:**
**Challenge:** Choosing the right HTML tags for better accessibility.
**Solution:**
```html
<main class="main">          <!-- Main content -->
  <article class="card">     <!-- Self-contained content -->
    <img alt="QR code image"> <!-- Descriptive alt -->
    <h2>                     <!-- Second-level heading -->
    <p>                      <!-- Descriptive text -->
  </article>
</main>
```

### üí° Key Insights for Overcoming Challenges

1. **Flexbox - universal solution:** For simple layouts, Flexbox solves most alignment tasks
2. **CSS variables save time:** Centralized color management simplifies experiments
3. **Mobile-first simplifies responsiveness:** Starting with mobile version makes it easier to scale up
4. **Developer tools are your best friend:** DevTools help with color selection and style debugging
5. **Semantics from the start:** Proper HTML structure lays the foundation for the entire project

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

### üîç Areas for Feedback

**1. CSS Architecture and Scalability:**
```css
/* Current CSS variables structure */
:root {
  --color-white: #fff;
  --color-black: #1F314F;
  --color-gray: #68778D;
}
```
**Questions:**
- Did I organize CSS variables correctly for a small project?
- How should I name CSS variables for colors: by purpose (`--color-primary`) or by color (`--color-gray`)?
- Should I extract sizes and spacing into variables for such a simple component?

**2. Accessibility:**
```html
<img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code image" class="card__image">
```
**Areas for improvement:**
- Is the alt text descriptive enough for the QR code?
- Do I need to add `role` attributes for better screen reader support?
- How to properly implement focus states for a component without interactive elements?

**3. Performance and Optimization:**
```css
.main {
  height: 95%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
**Specific questions:**
- Does using `height: 95%` affect rendering performance?
- Should I add `will-change` property for potential animations?
- How to optimize CSS for critical rendering path?

**4. Responsive Design Patterns:**
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 475px) {
  .card {
    margin: 27.5px;
  }
}
```
**Feedback needed on:**
- Is the 475px breakpoint correctly chosen for mobile devices?
- Should I use `clamp()` function for smoother responsiveness?
- How to better test the component on various devices?

**5. BEM Methodology and Naming:**
```css
.card__image { }
.card__heading { }
.card__text { }
```
**Questions on naming convention:**
- Is BEM methodology correctly applied in this context?
- Should I use modifiers (`card--large`) for component variations?
- How to better structure CSS for development teams?

**6. Modern CSS Techniques:**
```css
.card {
  border-radius: 20px;
  background-color: var(--color-white);
  padding: 16px 16px 40px 16px;
}
```
**Areas to explore:**
- When should I use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox for such layouts?
- How to properly implement CSS logical properties (`padding-inline`, `margin-block`)?
- Should I use CSS `@container` queries for the component?
